      <h1>NYC Social Distancing Complaints by Community District and Location</h1>
      <p class="byline"><i><strong>By Joseph Jungermann</strong></i></p>
      <p>Since <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">New York City Open Data</a> began recording social distancing complaints due to COVID-19 in late March, borough residents have made over 30,000 calls to the NYPD to date.</p>

      <p>And though only a small fraction of resident complaints have resulted in arrests, police have kept busy ever since Governor Andrew Cuomo implemented a statewide lockdown in mid-March.</p>

      <p>COVID-19 cases have since decreased and social distancing measures have eased across the state, but the paranoia of catching coronavirus still remains.</p>

      <p>Community watchdogs have cracked down on those who have chosen not to abide by the rule of keeping at least six-feet of space between each person and no gatherings of 10 or more people.</p>

          "use strict";
          window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
            if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
              for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
              }
          }))
        }();
      </script>
      <p>From the period of March 28 to May 10, NYPD officials have answered an average of 716 social distance complaints per day. The median number of complaints during that span was 665, with the most complaints occurring on May 2, when the NYPD
        fielded nearly 2,000 formal complaints.</p>

      <p>On that day, reports revealed that 4,405 NYPD officers on sick leave due to COVID had returned. That dropped the total amount of officers absent to only 6%, which could have contributed to the increased speed in processing reports.</p>

      <p>The May 2 complaints also came just a day after the United States saw a spike in nearly 34,000 new cases.</p>

      <p>On April 28, when the total amount of complaints eclipsed 1,000 for the third time, the Navy’s Blue Angels and the Air Force’s Thunderbirds were completing a flyover across New York City to honor essential workers and first responders. The
        event likely contributed to groups of people gathering to the discomfort of others.</p>

      <p>Organizing the data by community district gives a snapshot of which areas have had the most complaints to date.</p>

              }
          }))
        }();
      </script>
      <p>Brooklyn Community District 1, the area of East Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Northside, Southside and Williamsburg, had the most complaints with 1,336. The district is home to several community parks including McCarren Park and McGorlick Park,
        where residents routinely gather.</p>

      <p>But the problematic location was Berry Playground. Out of 31,000 complaints, only 15 resulted in NYPD officials making an arrest but four of those arrests occurred in Brooklyn Community District 1.</p>

      <p>Two of those arrests occurred at Berry Playground between Berry Street and Bedford Avenue despite parks and playgrounds fielding the least amount of complaints by 311 data location types.</p>

              }
          }))
        }();
      </script>
      <p>Brooklyn Community District 1 did not have a specific location that was targeted more often than others across the city in terms of places where most social distancing complaints were filed.</p>

      <p>Instead, Central Park was the area that tallied the most calls. The complete top 10 places with the most complaints are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Central Park, Manhattan CD 64, 121 complaints</li>
        <li>West 91 St., Manhattan CD 07, 91 complaints</li>
        <li>Sterling St., Brooklyn CD 09, 54 complaints</li>
        <li>Hoe Avenue, Bronx CD 03, 47 complaints</li>
        <li>Merriam Avenue, Bronx CD 04, 44 complaints</li>
        <li>Prospect Park, Brooklyn CD 55, 42 complaints</li>
        <li>East 2nd Street, Manhattan CD 03, 39 complaints</li>
        <li>Jamaica Avenue, Brooklyn CD 05, 39 complaints</li>
        <li>47 Street, Brooklyn CD 12, 38 complaints</li>
        <li>St. Nicholas Avenue, Manhattan CD 10, 37 complaints</li>
      </ol>
      <p>As the pandemic begins to ease across New York, so do people's fears of gathering. But it's clear that any spike in COVID cases could mean more reliance on the NYPD to intervene and break-up those reluctant to keep space.</p>

      <p>And those playing the role of social distance watchdog will continue to hold the rest accountable.</p>
